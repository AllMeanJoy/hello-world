Almin (All-Mean) Murgic here. I am new to coding and have begun self-teaching myself. 
I am starting with python and welcome any and all suggestions for a second language to learn afterwards. 
I currently work in the health and fitness field as a personal trainer.
I started coding becuase I have always loved to learn and coding seemed fun. I quickly realized just how much there is to learn (HOOKED!. 
Thus far, I have had fun coding during my first python course (PY4E). 
I enjoy the endorphins you get from debugging your code and getting it to work (finally) after hours of tweaks.
